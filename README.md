# Automatic-Door-Opening-System-
This was our mini project in which we had developed a system which will open the door as and when any human face is detected, validating the redundancies in the previous systems in which doors open using pressure mat. 

In this system we had used a motor which was controlled by GPIO pins of raspberry pi.
As soon as any face was detected the door could open.
